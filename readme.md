# synonms NATS #

synonms NATS is a NATS Streaming Client API for Qt 5.

Feel free to use synonms NATS for any purpose as long it's not illegal, unethical or damaging to any individuals or entities.


## NATS Lib ##

NATS Lib is the core library.  There are no dependencies other than Qt and it's probably easiest to copy the project into your own subdirs based solution and build it there.  It's currently templated as a shared library but can easily be amended to build statically.

## NATS UI ##

NATS UI is a bare bones sample app demonstrating usage of NATS Lib.  It is not required for your own solutions.
